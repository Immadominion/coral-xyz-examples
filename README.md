# Coral XYZ Dart Examples

This repository contains example Flutter/Dart projects demonstrating how to use the [dart-coral-xyz](https://github.com/immadominion/dart-coral-xyz) package to interact with Solana programs using the Anchor framework.

## Structure

Each folder (e.g., `basic_counter/`) is a self-contained example showing a specific use case or integration pattern with the Coral XYZ Anchor Dart client.

- **`basic_counter/`**: A simple counter app demonstrating program initialization, PDA derivation, and method calls on Solana using Dart.

## Getting Started

2. Each example contains its own `README.md` and setup instructions.
3. Sensitive files (like private keys) are excluded from version control by default.
